                The ausTIN CANs equips students with essential life skills such as communication, teamwork, and professionalism.
                <br><br>
                The ausTIN CANs was founded in the fall of 2006 under leader John W. Sperry. Our rookie year in FIRST was in the 2007 game “Rack ‘n Roll.” During the team’s rookie year in FRC, we were recognized with the Rookie All-Star award. This qualified us for the FRC World Championships in Atlanta, Georgia. Our team started out with ten student members, one teacher sponsor, and three university engineering student mentors. Currently we are under leader Vincent Wrencher and have grown to a substantial thirty-nine student members, numerous sponsors, and nine qualified mentors who teach the team.
